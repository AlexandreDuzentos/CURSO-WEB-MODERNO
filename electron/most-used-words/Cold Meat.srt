00:39:51,726 --> 00:39:54,695
Pretty effective stuff,
I have to admit.

362
00:39:54,795 --> 00:39:55,763
What is it?

363
00:39:57,298 --> 00:39:58,666
You wanna
know my trade secret?

364
00:39:58,766 --> 00:39:59,800
Mm-hmm.

365
00:40:01,736 --> 00:40:04,138
There are so many
options from desflurane

366
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:06,807
to sevoflurane isoflurane.

367
00:40:06,908 --> 00:40:10,511
Basically, my recipe ends
in 'flurane', if that helps.

368
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:11,746
Keep that to yourself.

369
00:40:11,846 --> 00:40:14,048
I'm sure the cops
will be thrilled to hear that.

370
00:40:19,287 --> 00:40:20,688
I tried chloroform at the start.

371
00:40:20,788 --> 00:40:22,623
I thought
you never did this before.

372
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:27,460
But chloroform,

373
00:40:27,561 --> 00:40:28,829
you can take up
to five minutes for someone

374
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,798
to pass out from inhaling
that shit.

375
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:34,035
Do you know
how long five minutes is?

376
00:40:36,504 --> 00:40:37,939
Five minutes.

377
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,841
And in that time, they--

378
00:40:40,942 --> 00:40:44,779
they kick, they punch,
they grab...

379
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,516
tear at your hair,

380
00:40:48,616 --> 00:40:51,018
and you have no control over
how much they're inhaling

381
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:53,721
because it's all
based on their breathing.

382
00:40:53,821 --> 00:40:58,960
And if they're panicked they
breathe too deeply, too quickly,

383
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,061
you know what happens?

384
00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:05,232
They die,
right there in your arms.

385
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:08,803
Kind of takes the fun out of it.

386
00:41:10,071 --> 00:41:11,739
So, no chloroform.

387
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,908
I like to keep control.

388
00:41:16,377 --> 00:41:18,646
You're no longer in control,
asshole!

389
00:41:19,847 --> 00:41:20,915
A knife doesn't put you
in control

390
00:41:21,015 --> 00:41:22,083
unless you're prepared
to use it.

391
00:41:22,183 --> 00:41:23,250
Don't tempt me.

392
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:26,620
At least I'm free.

393
00:41:26,721 --> 00:41:29,090
-Free? Really?
-Mmm.

394
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:32,059
You can choose between
dying slowly in here

395
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,427
or quickly outside.

396
00:41:33,527 --> 00:41:35,730
That's the only
freedom you have.

397
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:39,266
So, tell me, why the hell
are you still inside then?

398
00:41:45,139 --> 00:41:46,207
Oh, I get it.

399
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:48,809
You've already tried.

400
00:41:50,244 --> 00:41:54,749
(LAUGHS)

401
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:57,752
I'm just imagining you escaping
from the trunk back there,

402
00:41:57,852 --> 00:42:00,488
getting outside
and then realising

403
00:42:00,588 --> 00:42:01,589
there's nowhere to go

404
00:42:01,689 --> 00:42:03,090
and you'd have to get back
into the car.

405
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,259
Oh, that's brutal!

406
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,829
It's just funny that you swapped
one cage for another.

407
00:42:10,097 --> 00:42:12,500
Only this time the
shark's inside with you.

408
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,901
A shark with no teeth.

409
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:15,136
Hmm.

410
00:42:19,974 --> 00:42:21,242
So, what now?

411
00:42:22,276 --> 00:42:24,278
What do you plan to do
with me, Annie Wilkes?

412
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:25,780
I don't give
a shit about you.

413
00:42:27,048 --> 00:42:29,650
As soon as things calm down,
I'll take my chances outside.

414
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,951
Oh, good luck then.

415
00:42:32,753 --> 00:42:34,955
How far do you think
you'll get in this blizzard?

416
00:42:35,056 --> 00:42:35,956
500 yards?

417
00:42:36,057 --> 00:42:37,858
A mile?

418
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:39,960
It's minus four degrees outside.

419
00:42:40,061 --> 00:42:43,130
-I'll make it.
-No, you won't.

420
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:46,167
I climbed up that hill
and nearly died in ten minutes.

421
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:47,868
You're not equipped
to make it through this storm.

422
00:42:47,968 --> 00:42:50,204
Even with my hat and my gloves.

423
00:42:51,138 --> 00:42:54,075
Many factors can keep
you alive during the storm.

424
00:42:54,175 --> 00:42:57,311
The body will work overtime
to protect its vitals,

425
00:42:57,411 --> 00:42:58,813
the head and the organs.

426
00:42:58,913 --> 00:43:00,981
It doesn't care
about extremities.

427
00:43:01,082 --> 00:43:03,918
So, I intend to walk away
from here with everything

428
00:43:04,018 --> 00:43:05,653
I have intact.

429
00:43:06,555 --> 00:43:07,955
On the other hand,

430
00:43:08,055 --> 00:43:11,025
many factors can
accelerate hypothermia:

431
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:14,161
body fat, age,
alcohol consumption,

432
00:43:14,261 --> 00:43:17,264
injury- sorry- and wetness.

433
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:20,501
Your clothes are soaked.

434
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:22,636
They'll freeze pretty fast.

435
00:43:23,572 --> 00:43:25,039
I'm not sure you'll make it.

436
00:43:26,307 --> 00:43:27,542
-Fuck me.
-Mmhmm.

437
00:43:27,641 --> 00:43:29,110
Waitress with
a medical degree.

438
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,979
I don't need one.
I grew up in the cold.

439
00:43:33,414 --> 00:43:36,250
Your best chance of survival
is to stay in here with me.

440
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:38,953
That'd be the smartest choice,
given the circumstances.

441
00:43:39,954 --> 00:43:41,789
-Trust me.
-Trust you?

442
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:47,529
You know, you and I
got off on the wrong foot.

443
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:49,063
There's no 'you and I', asshole.

444
00:43:49,163 --> 00:43:50,798
Well,
whether you like it or not,

445
00:43:50,898 --> 00:43:52,366
we're both in the same shit now.

446
00:43:52,466 --> 00:43:53,968
Not for long.

447
00:43:54,068 --> 00:43:56,270
You know
what I'll do before I go.

448
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:57,972
I'll make damn sure that you are

449
00:43:58,072 --> 00:44:00,808
attached and strapped
down to this chair,

450
00:44:00,908 --> 00:44:03,811
and then I'll leave the car
doors wide open

451
00:44:03,911 --> 00:44:05,212
and with some luck,

452
00:44:05,312 --> 00:44:07,715
we'll find your frozen body
by the end of the winter.

453
00:44:07,815 --> 00:44:08,983
Unless of course

454
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:11,418
the wild animals have taken care
of you first.

455
00:44:25,799 --> 00:44:27,268
How long have I been out?

456
00:44:27,368 --> 00:44:28,335
Not long enough.

457
00:44:28,435 --> 00:44:30,104
Listen, if you wanna survive,

458
00:44:30,204 --> 00:44:33,140
we've got to start saving
on the fuel and on the battery.

459
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,708
We can only use the heat
for a couple of minutes

460
00:44:34,808 --> 00:44:36,810
every day or else
we won't last long.

461
00:44:36,911 --> 00:44:38,212
I don't intend
to stay here long.

462
00:44:38,312 --> 00:44:39,713
You don't know if we have
to stay here two hours,

463
00:44:39,813 --> 00:44:41,282
two days or two weeks.

464
00:44:41,382 --> 00:44:43,618
We can survive without
food, but without heat.

465
00:44:43,717 --> 00:44:45,686
The cold's gonna kill
us in a couple of hours.

466
00:44:45,786 --> 00:44:47,321
Hypothermia, remember?

467
00:44:50,525 --> 00:44:51,892
Turn it off.

468
00:44:55,597 --> 00:44:56,997
Turn it off!

469
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:03,304
You move one muscle.

470
00:45:03,404 --> 00:45:08,042
(WIND HOWLING)

471
00:45:19,286 --> 00:45:21,355
You are not from around here,
are you?

472
00:45:21,455 --> 00:45:23,190
I like to travel.

473
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:25,259
David Herman Petersen.

474
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:26,794
That name.

475
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:28,495
Is that your real name at least?

476
00:45:29,664 --> 00:45:31,098
It's not important.

477
00:45:31,198 --> 00:45:33,801
To me you're just
Fucked Up Motherfucker.

478
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:35,502
You don't mind if I call
you that, do you,

479
00:45:35,604 --> 00:45:38,038
Fucked Up Motherfucker?

480
00:45:43,744 --> 00:45:45,846
Seems like nobody
knows who you really are.

481
00:45:45,946 --> 00:45:47,649
I'm a shy guy.

482
00:45:47,748 --> 00:45:49,216
And I'm guessing you
don't have a kid either.

483
00:45:49,316 --> 00:45:51,118
Oh, you're a smart girl.

484
00:45:51,218 --> 00:45:52,886
That must be where Ella gets her
brain's from,

485
00:45:52,987 --> 00:45:55,055
'cause it ain't from Vince.

486
00:45:55,155 --> 00:45:56,423
How do you know
my daughter's name?

487
00:45:56,524 --> 00:46:00,094
Oh, I know a lot about you Ana,
and you know shit about me.

488
00:46:00,194 --> 00:46:02,096
I know more than
enough about you.

489
00:46:03,264 --> 00:46:06,100
And don't you ever bring up
my daughter's name again.

490
00:46:13,474 --> 00:46:17,878
(WIND HOWLING)

491
00:46:23,752 --> 00:46:24,818
Those fucking seats
are expensive.

492
00:46:24,918 --> 00:46:26,186
You're gonna pay for that.

493
00:46:33,595 --> 00:46:34,529
What?

494
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:36,830
My bonds are too tight.

495
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:38,667
They're cutting into my wrists.

496
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:40,034
Don't worry about it.

497
00:46:40,134 --> 00:46:41,569
After a while, you won't even
feel your hands anymore.

498
00:46:50,512 --> 00:46:51,579
Why didn't you kill me?

499
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,517
I made up my own theory
back in the trunk.

500
00:46:56,584 --> 00:46:57,818
Wanna hear it?

501
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:00,789
Superiority complex.

502
00:47:00,888 --> 00:47:02,056
You got sloppy.

503
00:47:02,156 --> 00:47:04,358
-I'm never sloppy.
-You were overconfident.

504
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:06,193
You still are.

505
00:47:06,293 --> 00:47:08,228
You should have killed
me when you could.

506
00:47:08,329 --> 00:47:10,898
If I wanted to just kill
you, you'd be dead by now.

507
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:13,967
You had other
plans for me, right?

508
00:47:16,671 --> 00:47:18,540
Sick motherfucker.

509
00:47:22,577 --> 00:47:23,911
Why didn't you kill me?

510
00:47:24,978 --> 00:47:26,847
It would've been so easy
when I was out cold.

511
00:47:26,947 --> 00:47:28,849
Because I'm not like you.

512
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:30,284
I'm not a monster.

513
00:47:30,384 --> 00:47:32,219
Oh.

514
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,289
Oh, in the right circumstances,
we can all be cruel.

515
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:36,890
Even you.

516
00:47:39,193 --> 00:47:40,729
Imagine.

517
00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:42,296
Just imagine.

518
00:47:43,665 --> 00:47:45,499
Someone hurting little Ella.

519
00:47:49,069 --> 00:47:52,339
Don't you ever mention
my daughter's name again.

520
00:47:52,439 --> 00:47:54,108
Okay.

521
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:55,442
Okay.

522
00:47:55,543 --> 00:47:56,944
Okay.

523
00:48:04,786 --> 00:48:06,053
You see?

524
00:48:07,121 --> 00:48:08,989
It's just about circumstance.

525
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:17,431
First time's never easy.

526
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:20,334
But after time,
you get used to it.

527
00:48:22,837 --> 00:48:24,004
Who knows?

528
00:48:25,005 --> 00:48:26,641
Ana, you could even enjoy it.

529
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:29,376
Oh, I could teach
you some things.

530
00:48:29,476 --> 00:48:31,011
Shut up!

531
00:48:38,152 --> 00:48:39,319
You got anything to eat?

532
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,921
(LAUGHS)

533
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:42,289
What's so funny?

534
00:48:42,389 --> 00:48:45,292
I nearly bought a pack of
cookies back at the gas station.

535
00:48:45,392 --> 00:48:47,027
I didn't wanna use
my credit card.

536
00:48:47,127 --> 00:48:49,029
They can trace you so easily
with a credit card.

537
00:48:50,364 --> 00:48:52,933
I only had enough cash

Talks of a spirit living
in the forest

which comes to hunt people
like you.

it comes to get them,

he ran out on us
when I was nine.

Never saw him again.

939
01:17:43,397 --> 01:17:45,366
My mother was already a drinker.

940

One of the only two
things they had in common.

941
01:17:50,738 --> 01:17:52,339
The other one was me.

942
01:17:54,241 --> 01:17:58,212
But when he left,
all she did is drink.

943
01:18:00,881 --> 01:18:04,185
She was much more
violent than my father.

944
01:18:04,285 --> 01:18:09,423
After he left, I got scared
and I pissed the bed.

945
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:18,199
When she found out,
she beat me.

946
01:18:20,701 --> 01:18:23,204
And every night
I pissed the bed.

949
01:18:29,877 --> 01:18:32,079
I grew up in an orphanage.

950
01:18:33,648 --> 01:18:39,353
At nine, I got lucky and I
was adopted by a nice couple.

951
01:18:41,722 --> 01:18:44,425
The mother was affectionate.

952
01:18:44,526 --> 01:18:46,160
The father was attentive.

953
01:18:48,028 --> 01:18:50,497
But not long after I arrived,

954
01:18:52,933 --> 01:18:55,736
the attention became
more than I wanted.

955
01:18:57,338 --> 01:18:59,406
Than any child wants.

956
01:19:02,309 --> 01:19:08,048
Things happen in... in silence
until I was 15.

957
01:19:10,284 --> 01:19:12,753
And then I started
getting into trouble.

958
01:19:12,853 --> 01:19:15,189
Sound familiar?

959
01:19:16,423 --> 01:19:22,396
And then I finally spoke up
and my father went to jail.

960
01:19:24,666 --> 01:19:31,472
And then came the drink,
the drugs, the violence, jail.

961
01:19:33,807 --> 01:19:37,444
Then... then I became a mother.

962
01:19:39,847 --> 01:19:46,020
And I've only given
Ella love and kindness.

963
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:49,023
even though life
wasn't kind to me.

964

you're looking for excuses,

the lives you took.

do with your mother.

In a couple of hours,
the cold will take us.

That solves everything.

971
01:20:19,953 --> 01:20:23,991
It was one advantage to the cold
that I didn't expect.

01:20:25,125 --> 01:20:27,861
I can't feel the pain
in my leg anymore.
